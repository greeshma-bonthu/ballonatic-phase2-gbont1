In the phase 2 development i have implemented login and sign up pages. I have changed all my html pages into ejs. Then worked upon existing pages and added the 
login and sign up pages.

For the login page i have implemented animated panda which welcomes you to login.

So, whenever the user tries to login the login page tries to authenticate with mock db and checks whether the information is correct or not. If the user gives wrong information 
message will appear in login page "Invalid Username or password".
If the user gives correct information in login page then user will login into the home page and logout button will be highleted in home page.

In the sign up page all the validation and the users personal information given in sign up page will be stored and will be allowed to login.

In the home page enhancement the random products of 3 will be displayed in the home page and also random quotes will be displayed in the home page for every 30 seconds.

In the phase-3 i would like to implement the project using Mongodb and also i would like to implement search bar where we can search for the products and find them using Mongodb.
